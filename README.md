Unity Project of the game I - Eunchan Koh - created. Named "Tower Defence" since genre of this game is tower defence.

Link to Played video:
(will be added)

Link to download playable build exported:
(might will be added)

What will be (or can be) added further:
- More types of enemy
- More proper level design(there are lots of enemy types created but they are not inserted in the stages yet. Current project only spawns basic enemy & boss enemy types.)
- more larger map(seems like map is way too small, can be fixed.)
- UIs(adding entrance scene, removing quit button from playing scene, adding setting UI, proper images for player hp, adding proper UI for buying Tower, etc.)
- More stages with more maps
- Tower Upgrade Function
- more exciting functions(air bombing support, traps that can create area which slow downs the enemy in the area, etc.)
- more visual effects (shaking screen on specific boss patterns, etc.)
- more specific game rules(money obtained by defeating each enemys are all the same for now, will be different. Also, destroying tower does not return player any money they spent on building those towers, can make some change on this)

!since I am working on & studying about 3d projects, above functions' development might will be done later.
